# Fraud Detection

The world is moving forward with digital modes of payments and have seen a lot of traction. Customers benefit from digital payments because they make financial transactions easier. However, this also invited many fraudsters to make use of gaps and dupe the customers in different ways.

Here the aim is to build a machine learning model which can predict whether a fraud can occur. This helps people to be warned beforehand during a transaction and can help to improve the security of payment/transactions from one domain to another domain.

## To Run this Model yourself:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1?resource=download).
3. Extract the dataset to your repository folder.
4. Open the [Model Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/anishakode/fraud_detection/blob/main/Model.ipynb).
5. Run this notebook.
